Minimal plugin for libpurple (pidgin, finch) to speak aloud all messages
received (using espeak). Only tested on Linux, but should work on Mac OS X, and
maybe Windows with some effort.

Installation:
    Download the perl script to your pidgin plugin directory (usually ~/.purple/plugins)
    See https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Scripting%20and%20Plugins#HowdoIusePerlscriptswithPidginFinch

Dependencies:
    espeak (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
